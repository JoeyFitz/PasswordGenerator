# Password Generator
## Description
We, as people, are inherently lazy. And that quality is no more apparent than in our password creation habits. But forming a robust and purely random string of letters, numbers, and special characters is easier than ever thanks to easy-to-use password generators. This repo houses one of them. PasswordGenerator was an early project in my web development career. It taught me a lot about how to create functional Javascript to enhance a web application. I plan to enhance its functionality further over the coming weeks as my understanding of the programming language grows. 

## User Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
So easy a cave man can do it. Please visit URL of the deployed application and click to generate a password. 'nuff said. 

## Credits
The internet. I needed to find other examples of devs using placeholder arrays and then using a for loop to create a random selection from another array and push that into the placeholder. Many thanks to the selfless folks smarter than me on stackoverflow and the mozilla org!
